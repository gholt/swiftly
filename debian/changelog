  * More auth systems support: Now supports Rackspace's v2.0 auth and
    Keystone's v2.0 auth in addition to the v1.0 auth support from before. This
    does its best to auto-detect what is needed, but you can also
    use --auth-methods to provide specific guidance. This also adds
    the --auth-tenant option for specifying the tenant to auth as; needed for
    some Keystone systems or to access a tenant other than your own.

  * Region support with --region and showing available regions with the auth
    command.

  * CDN management support with the --cdn option. This will direct requests to
    the CDN management url provided by auth, if available.

  * New tempurl command for easily creating Swift TempURLs.

  * Support for query parameters with the --query option.

  * Operations that before did not take request bodies, like puts and deletes,
    now can with the --input and -I options. This is useful with archive puts
    and bulk deletes, for examples, and will hopefully transparently support
    any similar future Swift features.

  * Support for static large objects as well as the previously supported
    dynamic large objects.

  * Eventlet now auto-enabled if Eventlet is version 0.11.0 or higher (when a
    CPU usage bug was fixed). You can override with --no-eventlet if desired.

  * Refactored verbosity level handling.
